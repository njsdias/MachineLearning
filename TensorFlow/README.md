### 1. Purpose
This repository covers the essential of Tensorflow for Machine Learning with the objective to increase the knowledge of the best approaches in Machine Learning. For that the structure of repository follows the subjects related with Machine Learning (not Deep Learning) of the book _Building Machine Learning Projects with Tensor Flow_ .

The explanations and the comments as well the code are transcripted from the book. 
So, all rights are attributed to the author of the book.

The main objective is learning with examples well explained. 

Note: Some code can be different from the original only to stay in accordance with the new features released by the new version of Tensor Flow.

This repo uses TensorFlow 1.13.1 version and the book uses the TensorFlow 0.10 version.
