### 1. Analyzing and Predicting Telecommunication Churn

Churn prediction is fundamental to businesses, as it allows them to detect customers who
are likely to cancel a subscription, product, or service. It can also minimize customer
defection. It does so by predicting which customers are likely to cancel a subscription to a
service. Then, the respective business can have a special offer or plan for those customers
(who might cancel the subscription). This way, a business can reduce the churn ratio. This
should be a key business goal of every online business.

When it comes to employee churn prediction, the typical task is to determine what factors
predict an employee leaving his/her job. For this, a
number of factors should be analyzed in order to understand the customer's behavior,
including but not limited to:

- Customer's demographic data, such as age, marital status, and so on

- Customer's sentiment analysis of social media

- Browsing behavior from clickstream logs

- Historical data that shows patterns of behavior that suggest churn

- Customer's usage patterns and geographical usage trends

- Calling-circle data and support call center statistics
