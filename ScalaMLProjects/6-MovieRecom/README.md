# 1. Developing Model-based Movie Recommendation Engines

In this chapter, we will see two end-to-end projects and develop a model for **item-based
collaborative filtering** for movie similarity measurement and a **model-based movie
recommendation engine** with Spark that recommends movies for new users. We will see
how to interoperate between ALS and matrix factorization (MF) for these two scalable
movie recommendation engines. We will use the movie lens dataset for the project. Finally,
we will see how to deploy the best model in production.

In a nutshell, we will learn the following topics through two end-to-end projects:

- Recommendation system: how and why?

- Item-based collaborative filtering for movie similarity

- Model-based movie recommendation with Spark

- Model deployment
