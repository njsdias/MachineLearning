The role of Recommender Systems (RS) becomes critical for recommending relevant items and
driving customer conversion in situations where there are zilions of different products available since the user donâ€™t like to invest a lot of time going through the entire catalogue of items.
     
Recommender systems are mainly used for auto-suggesting the right
content or product to the right users in a personalized manner to enhance
the overall experience. Each of the decisions of users (Positive or Negative) helps to retrain the
RS on the latest data to be able to give even better recommendations.
