# 1. Few Considerations

it is important to go over
these assumptions very quickly in order to know them before using the
Linear Regression model.
Assumptions:

• There must be a linear relationship between the input
variable and output variable.

• The independent variables (input features) should not be
correlated to each other (also known as multicollinearity).

• There must be no correlation between the residuals/
error values.

• There must be a linear relationship between the
residuals and the output variable.

• The residuals/error values must be normally
distributed.


The majority of the time, the dataset would contain multiple variables and hence building a
**Multivariable Regression Model** makes more sense in such a situation
